I am a Research Assistant in the College of Engineering and Applied Science at the University of Cincinnati, working with Prof. Tommaso Giovannelli on multi-agent large language model (LLM) systems.

**Role:** Research Assistant – Multi-Agent LLM Systems  
**Institution:** University of Cincinnati, College of Engineering and Applied Science  
**Location:** Cincinnati, Ohio, United States  
**Dates:** Oct 2025 – Present  

**Focus areas:**

- Conduct research on multi-agent LLM systems with a focus on reasoning coordination, emergent behavior, and optimization.  
- Investigate Chain-of-Thought prompting, meta-reasoning, and bilevel optimization to improve collaboration and self-organization among autonomous agents.  
- Collaborate with Griffin Kent on evaluation frameworks for cooperative and competitive LLM agents in distributed environments.  
- Use Python, PyTorch, AWS Lambda, and custom inference pipelines to simulate and measure decision-making performance across diverse task domains.  
- Contribute to future publications in intelligent multi-agent coordination, interpretability, and AI-driven systems engineering.

**Advisor:** Prof. Tommaso Giovannelli
