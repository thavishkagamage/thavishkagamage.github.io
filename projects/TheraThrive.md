TheraThrive is a full-stack web application that delivers guided Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) sessions through an AI-powered chatbot. It is designed to make mental health support more accessible for people who struggle with depression, low motivation, or social withdrawal.

The platform guides users through structured CBT conversations using static prompt engineering and the OpenAI API. The goal is not to replace therapists, but to offer a free and flexible option for people who may face barriers such as cost, scheduling, or limited provider availability.
